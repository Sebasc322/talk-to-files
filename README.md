# talk-to-files
A Web application that lets you ask questions to your PDFs and CSV files. It also helps you create a fast Exploratory Data Analysis on your CSV file


There are two tabs depending on the file type you want to upload, and what you want to do with it.

If it is a PDF file, just click on the PDF tab and you will be able to ask questions to the file and get answers.

If it is a CSV file, just click on the CSV tab and you will be able to ask questions to the file and get answers, or generate a quick EDA from the CSV file.
